This is the code repository for [Kubernetes for Developers ](https://prod.packtpub.com/in/virtualization-and-cloud/kubernetes-developers?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788834759), published by Packt.

**Distributed search, analytics, and visualization using Elasticsearch, Logstash, Beats and Kibana**

## What is this book about?
Kubernetes is documented and typically approached from the perspective of someone running software that has already been built. Kubernetes may also be used to enhance the development process, enabling more consistent testing and analysis of code to help developers verify not only its correctness, but also its efficiency. This book introduces key Kubernetes concepts, coupled with examples of how to deploy and use them with a bit of Node.js and Python example code, so that you can quickly replicate and use that knowledge.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Build your software into containers
* Deploy and debug software running in containers within Kubernetes
* Declare and add configuration through Kubernetes
* Define how your application fits together, using internal and external services
* Add feedback to your code to help Kubernetes manage your services

```
import signal
import sys
def sigterm_handler(_signo, _stack_frame):
sys.exit(0)
signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, sigterm_handler)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for entry-level data professionals, software engineers, e-commerce developers, full-stack developers who want to understand everything about Elastic stack and learn how the real-time processing and search engine works for business analytics and enterprise search applications.No previous experience with the Elastic stack is required; However, concepts of data warehousing and databases would be helpful.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
